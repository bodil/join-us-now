* Why we do open source
** Where it came from
*** The parable of rms and the printer.
**** 70s hacker ethos - share software for good karma.
*** Going corporate as open source.
**** Sharing back means reduced development cost.
** The movements' leaders are unpleasant white men.
*** The ideas are too important for one white guy.
* Our collective knowledge (why it matters to me)
** What we know is out there in public, and you can go find it and learn.
** Free Software exists to safeguard it.
*** This gives us - as a species - unprecedented agency!
*** Intellectual property threatens our future.
**** What if only Elon Musk knows how to go to Mars?
** Open source alone is not enough.
*** the four freedoms!
** If not for Free Software, patent lawyers would rule us.
*** We wouldn't be able to write a single line of code without risking getting sued by a megacorp with a patent portfolio.
